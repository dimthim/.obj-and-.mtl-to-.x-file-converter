# obj_and_mtl_to_x_FileConverter

(Additional features coming)

Converts wavefront .obj (and their .mtl files) of simple 3d meshes into a .x file that can be used with DirectX9

The for the program to works as is, it requires that the user have a directory called TempFiles in their working directory. 
TempFiles will hold the files you wish to convert from .obj/.mtl to .x.

Also required is a file in the working directory called ConvertMe.txt, which simply holds the names of the files in TempFiles.

I included a .bat file as an example of how you can streamline the process of conversion from the command line.
